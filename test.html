    It was quiet, only hearing the sound of raining tapping against the window, yet so soft and gentle to be considered to be soothing and calm. The sky was gleaming a natural form of purple and a tint of soft blues; it was dawn, just the beginning of the night. In this city of old fashion culture, Duchess or also known as Antediluvian Republic; it’s full of potential with an old fashion vibe. The design of brick pavements, brick architecture, grandfather clocks, it all surrounds you in mystery and wonder. The small bridges, the little canals, people whispering <em>‘Good day’</em> to one another out of kindness enclosures you with a sense of comfort and serenity. Little things like the fresh baked bread that the bakery would bake, or the pigeons being perched along railings against the canal bridges, the old man who warms your day by offering a bit of wisdom for your journey makes the environment feel dulcet. The swing music that softly plays and jazz and mellows the outside world is like a blanket covering you, providing the sweetness and warm mess of security as though it’s singing to you <em>‘Everything will be okay’</em>. Duchess; a place where dreams are possible and those who are talented and the ambition to do so will go beyond what’s imaginable.

    As the sky still cried silently, gentle as a lamb, there was a small being that lived in this great big world. Living amongst infamous brick buildings of what made Duchess so unique, being so defined in structure yet so simple and small, but spacious on the inside, there was a person. The person was sitting on their bed, looking at a book. Although the book looked worn out, used over time, the leather was still intact though but the pages were slightly faded to an extent. There were glass bottles filled with colorful liquid, yet the glasses resembled much to like laboratory glassware. There were diversity of herbs spread amongst the duvet of the bed and flower buds amongst them. They looked like they were used for medicine in some sort, or just plants to the naked eye. Their room was large but simple; rustic wooden floors with a medium-to-high ceiling. The bed had no bed frame, just a mattress simply resting on the floor but it did no harm. Their room was decorated with herbs hanging off the ceiling, resembling like ordinary ceiling plants. Gems and rocks like Rose Quartz and Chalcedony, but Dragon’s Breath was their favorite. In addition to the room’s features, their cat would often walk by and longer around with them, watching every move they made.

    <em>
    Who was this person?
    </p>

    <p>
    What’s up with the exotic items?
    </p>

    <p>
    Is this person a witch?
    </em>
    </p>

    <p>
    Indeed not a witch, but this person is what makes Duchess unordinary but original to a sense. This person was a doctor, the doctor. <em>But what made them so different from the others? Their young age?</em> As the person read the book of ancients in a criss cross sitting position, their hands began to glow a subtle yet dull light which slowly illuminated the room. But the light was small, yet gentle like little fireflies dancing in the night. The feline across from them purred with content as their tail swayed from side to side, as though they were happy with the result. This person was a doctor, yet a strange one that some kind of celestial factor to them. Maybe Duchess wasn't so ordinary after all.

    The being breathed out calmly before closing their eyes and imagining the unknown. They let there body lay down in a limp manner, exhaling and inhaling the beguiling aroma of the candles that smelt like a warm autumn day. They let sleep take over them, inhaling and exhaling at ease. <em>But why so sudden must they sleep? Why must they count sheep?</em> As the person continued to dream away, the soft glow of their hands dimmed out. This time, it was their heart that started to glow; the most powerful source of all. Little small objects of the room started to levitate, fireflies emerged from the shadows, herbs blossomed even further. The rain still came down, but a little rougher than before. Thus it was no longer dawn, it was night. Yet the stars were too shy to come out tonight, may the darkened clouds cover them from the world above.
    </p>

    <p>
    In a placid moment like this, it was evident the person gained more power from dreams, healing those with their imagination and wisdom that came out of their heart, out of kindness and generosity. As the old man once said:
    </p>

    <p>
    <em>
    Educate the heart before the mind.
    </em>
    </p>

    <p>
    Everything in this moment looked so ethereal yet human in comforting sense. The feline continued to purr as they laid alongside with their friend, drifting off to sleep as well. Their dreams of the outside world of abnormality, yet ethereal in some kind of fantasy in taking them to distant lands of the living, firing up their inspiration to do the impossible is what keeps them going. So small, yet so brave, their heart is worth more then glitter and gold. Not following the normalities of science and chemicals like ordinary doctors, but achieved through herbs and the wisdom of the elders, this person will go far. Uncovering stories and secrets of what the abnormal world might hold, this being will encounter its wonders through lucid dreaming.
